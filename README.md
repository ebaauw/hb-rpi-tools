## Homebridge RPi Tools
Copyright © 2019-2026 Erik Baauw. All rights reserved.

This repository provides a standalone installation of the command-line utility from [Homebridge RPi](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-rpi):

- `rpi`, to monitor and control Raspberry Pi computers and devices conected to the Pi's GPIO pins.

The command-line tool takes a `-h` or `--help` argument to provide a brief overview of its functionality and command-line arguments.

### Prerequisites
You need to setup `lg` or `pigpio` on the Raspberry Pi for `rpi` to interact with it.  For details, see [GPIO Access](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-rpi/wiki/GPIO-Access) in the Homebridge RPi Wiki.
